# 🔍 Secure Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages **machine learning** to detect fraudulent transactions in **financial datasets**. The model analyzes transaction patterns to identify potential fraud in real-time, helping businesses and financial institutions **prevent unauthorized activities**.

## 🎯 Why This Matters for Security
Fraud detection is **critical for cybersecurity** and financial security. Cybercriminals exploit payment systems, stolen credentials, and phishing attacks to commit fraud. This project helps:

- 🔍 **Identify fraudulent transactions before financial loss occurs**
- 🛡️ **Enhance financial security & fraud prevention**
- 📊 **Provide real-time fraud detection using AI models**
- ✅ **Comply with regulations like PCI DSS & AML**

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anita-ani/fraud-detection-security.git
cd fraud-detection-security
```

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ **Run the Notebook** (Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook) - I used Google Colab.

```bash
jupyter notebook fraud_detection.ipynb
```

## 📊 Dataset
We use the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains **284,315 normal transactions** and **142,157 fraudulent transactions**.

🔗 **Download the dataset**: [Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

Upload the dataset (`creditcard.csv`) to your project folder before running the code.

## 🛠️ Model Training & Evaluation

### **Step 1: Load and Preprocess Data**
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')
df.head()
```


### **Step 2: Train Machine Learning Models**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('Class', axis=1), df['Class'], test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```


### **Step 3: Model Performance Evaluation**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print(f'✅ Model Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.4f}')
```
